# CryptoPortfolio

Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio!

In this project, I have combined two datasets to compare cryptocurrency prices at their peak in November 2021 to current cryptocurrency prices. I used my expertise in writing SQL queries to clean and organize the data for analysis, and I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the results. Take a look around and see how I turned complex data into actionable insights!
